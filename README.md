This repository provides a comprehensive guide on integrating Core Data with the SwiftUI App Life Cycle. It covers various topics and features that will help you develop a robust and feature-rich SwiftUI app. Below are the key topics covered in this repository:

1. **Integrating Core Data with SwiftUI App Life Cycle**: Learn how to seamlessly integrate Core Data into your SwiftUI app and manage the data life cycle effectively.

2. **Xcode's New Core Data Template**: Get familiar with Xcode's latest Core Data template, making it easier to set up your data model and entities.

3. **Creating Basic Widgets for iPhone and iPad Devices**: Explore how to create widgets for different device sizes, enabling users to access essential app information from the home screen.

5. **CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on Database Items**: Learn how to perform basic database operations to create, retrieve, update, and delete items stored in Core Data.

6. **Toggle Light and Dark Mode Appearances**: Implement light and dark mode appearances in your app, allowing users to switch between different color schemes based on their preferences.

7. **App Storage for Storing App's Appearance**: Utilize App Storage to store the app's appearance settings persistently, ensuring that the user's preferences are remembered across app launches.

8. **Setting up Widgets with Different Sizes (Small, Medium, Large)**: Configure widgets with varying sizes to provide users with different levels of information on their home screen.

9. **Preview Setup for Testing Different Widget Sizes**: Set up the preview environment to test and visualize the appearance of your widgets in different sizes.

10. **Creating Visual Effects with SwiftUI's Blur and Color Overlay Mode**: Enhance your app's user interface by adding visual effects like blur and color overlay using SwiftUI.
